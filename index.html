                    The word "guard dog" exists in most peoples' minds as an image of a large dog, perhaps a German shepherd or rottweiler if they know their breeds, standing out in someone's yard (or junkyard) and barking at passers-by. 
                    Unknown to most people, the world of guardian dogs is a vast one, rich with history that overlaps with the history of mankind in a way that stands out against a backdrop of the even wider world of dogs as a whole, due to the special connection we feel to our canine companions who serve along side us when we go to war, or for those who risk their lives to defend our families.

                    The way I would define "guardian dog" would be thus: any dog intimidating enough to serve as a deterrent, large enough to hold his own against an adversary, and with the bravery, drive, and protective instincts to be willing to do so. 
                    Not many dogs are all three. It takes an incredibly bold and confident dog to fight rather than flight, and these traits are becoming less common as working traits (such as strong drive, high energy, and instinct to defend) are being bred out of dogs in favor of more docile animals that are easier to live with.

                <bigger>
                    People that see the value in a protective companion are working against the trends to preserve the working quality of guardian breeds, training them to be utilized in many ways that continue the age-old relationship between man and dog: you provide for me and I provide for you.

            <h2>Whats in a Breed?</h2>
            <p>
                There are many, many different guardian dog breeds that exist in the world today, all across the globe. 
                Some are very popular, like the Rottweiler. 
                Others are rare and/or localized to a specific area, like the Rajapalyam dog which is rarely seen outside of India. 
                The breed of a dog is not the be-all, end-all of what makes a dog a guardian, but genetics play a significant role. 
                A dog whose ancestors were selectively bred to be protective will be protective instinctually; it is literally in that dog's blood, a trait that has been passed down through their bloodline with each generation being selected for that quality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the beginning dogs have been bred to perform specific tasks and purposes. 
                A guardian dog will likely come from a role in which guardian instincts would have been required, whether that be herding (such as the famous German Shepherd), droving (such as the Rottweiler and Giant Schnauzer), war (like the Cane Corso and Neapolitan mastiff who descended from ancient Roman war dogs), hunting (like the Akita), and finally livestock guarding (like the Kangal). 
                Many such roles overlap and many breeds were bred to perform multiple roles. For example, the Cane Corso has been used as a livestock guardian, hunting dog, herding dog, and general farm dog.
            </p>
            <p>
                While a dog's breed and lineage may be the most important determining factor of how he performs as a guardian, dogs are individuals and of course there will be exceptions to the rule. 
                Meaning even the notoriously friendly husky could serve as a guardian if you happened upon the right individual. 
                Nonetheless, it must be reiterated that the right genetics is arguably the number one most important thing a guardian dog has, making it important to choose the right breed to ensure you find a dog with the right genetics.

                    <h4>German Shepherd</h4>
                    <p>
                        This is probably the most recognizable guard dog breed, and for good reason. 
                        The German shepherd is a very versatile working breed, originally bred to herd and protect sheep and to serve as a “living fence” to keep the flock all together in one area. 
                        They’re highly trainable, good with families, great guardians, and great herding and general farm dogs. You can also find them serving in search and rescue operations, on the police force, and in the military. 
                        Due to their high working drives, intelligence and willingness to learn, and a naturally protective disposition, there’s not much that a German shepherd can’t do.

                    <h4>Belgian Malinois</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Belgian Malinois is similar to the German shepherd in appearance and temperament, and they are often confused for the more popular GSD. 
                        However, they are much higher energy as they have been bred from other Belgian sheepdog breeds to be a dependable dog that can work all day without tiring, so they are very intense. 
                        This is the number one breed used by the US military and the only breed employed by the Navy SEALs. 
                        They are extremely trainable, extremely intelligent, and very confident. A very experienced person who knows what they are doing cannot find a much better guardian than the Belgian Malinios. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Malinois is my second favorite breed (tied with the similar Dutch Shepherd). 
                        Every one I've met was super sweet, and I've seen how closely they bond to their family.
                        The ones I have met were bold and friendly.

                    <h4>Giant Schnuazer</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Giant Schnauzer is one of the world’s most successful guardian dog breeds. 
                        They were developed in 17th century Germany as general farm dogs and as drover dogs (driving livestock to the market). 
                        They have since been utilized as watchdogs, police dogs, dog sport dogs, and as protective companions. 
                        The Giant Schnauzer was virtually unknown outside of the central European region of Bavaria until he served in World War 2, which earned him international popularity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, the Giant Schnauzer is among the most common personal protection dogs. 
                        They are intelligent, trainable, driven, and have excellent temperaments ideal for a personal protector. 
                        Their wiry coats (which is a rather uncommon trait among the guardian breeds) make them a low-shedding breed suitable for those with allergies or sensitivities.

                    <h4>Beauceron</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Beauceron is a little-known shepherding breed from France. 
                        Often mistaken for ‘long coat Dobermans’ (which don’t exist), this breed is actually older than the doberman and may have been one of the breeds used to create the Doberman. 
                        They are highly intelligent and high-energy working dogs that make great, protective companions for experienced and active families.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Personally, this breed is my 3rd favorite breed. When I met them in person at my first dog show (the only place you’re likely to see one) the energy and presence they had was very unique. 
                        They exuded this confidence that d never felt from a dog before. 
                        I know I’d feel safe from any threat with a Beauceron at my side.

                    <h4>Akita</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Akita is another breed with two separate lines, the Japanese Akita Inu and the American Akita, with the American being closer to what the original Akitas were like before they split into separate lines. 
                        This breed is extremely loyal, powerful, and serious. 
                        They are the best guardians of all the spitz-type breeds. 
                        Originally bred in Japan as hunting (they hunted bears!) and guardian dogs, this formidable yet graceful animal became the epitome of loyalty thanks to the story of an Akita named Hachiko. 
                        Hachiko was an Akita who waited every day at a Japanese train station for his human who had passed away. 
                        He waited 10 years at the same spot being fed by regular commuters until Hachiko himself passed on. There’s even a memorial ceremony held every year at Shibuya Station in his honor garnering hundreds of attendees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Akita is a noble dog who demands respect from those around him. 
                        He needs a dedicated, knowledgeable, and responsible person who will treat him firmly yet fairly. 
                        The fortunate individuals who fulfill these requirements for their Akita will be rewarded with an exceptional companion and guardian, for life and beyond.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is my 4th favorite breed, and I’m of the opinion that the Akita belongs on every guard dog lover’s top 10 list.

                    <h4>Dobermann</h4>
                    <p>
                        There are two distinct lines of Doberman, the American line “Doberman pinscher”, and the European “Dobermann”. 
                        Unfortunately, much of the working qualities that the American Dobes had in the early 20th century have been bred out of them, so they are not suitable for guardian work. 
                        The only working Dobermans are the European variety, which are slightly larger and bulkier, and only come in black and red (americans come in two additional colors). 
                        The Doberman was created in 1800s in Germany by tax collecter Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann, who needed a dog to protect him while he did his rounds as a tax collecter. 
                        The Doberman is unique because they were the first and remain the only dog breed originally bred specifically to protect humans from human threats.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The European Dobermann is my number one, all time favorite breed. They’re affectionate to their people, bond strongly to one person, and are always alert and on the look out for any danger. 
                        They have this beautiful, striking, and intimidating appearance which I love.

                A personal protection dog is a dog who is trained to a high level to perform as both an obedient and trustworthy companion, as well as a bodyguard for their person or family. This kind of work requires that a dog be extremely confident, bordering fearless, obedient, physically and mentally fit, and that his innate defense drive can be turned on and off on command, all of which require years of specialized and intensive training. This purpose might be the ultimate job for a guardian dog because of how intense and specialized it is. Personal protection dogs are not born, they are made. 
                <ol class="list">
                    <li>
                        <b>First, a breeder/kennel must be selected</b> from a specialized and quality working line breeder whose dogs have proven health and working ability, then an especially promising puppy is chosen from a litter. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Then that puppy is socialized</b> to as much stimuli and stress as possible from birth (appropriate to the age of course). Socialization should really be continued throughout a dog’s life, especially a dog like this. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>The young dog should be trained in obedience</b> as soon as possible until he achieves a reliable level. Usually, protection-specific training is started towards the middle or end of obedience training.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Protection training</b> is a complicated process, throughout it many things are being worked on with many details being considered, even how full a dog’s mouth is when he bites is important and he will be trained to have a ‘full grip’ where his entire jaw will be latched onto his target.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>He will be trained to be confident</b>, tolerant of stressors, dependable, quick-acting, and to have controlled aggression, a good strong bite, a reliable ‘out’ command, and an ‘off switch’. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>The final stage involves a variety of simulated real-life scenarios</b> with hidden bite sleeves (think mugging, burglary, carjacking). This will determine if the dog will actually bite for real, in a realistic situation as well as prepare him for real life. 
                    </li>
                </ol>  
                This whole process should take a minimum of 2 years and, if the dog has been fully trained by a professional, can cost upwards of 50,000 dollars.
            </p>

                Perhaps the reason I find these dogs so cool (so much so that I felt the need to include this additional section just about them) is that they are truly special. While any dog with enough prey drive can go after and bite a sleeve, a personal protection dog will legitimately bite a person who he deems is a threat and is told to, because he wants to. That is rare, and while police and military dogs also bite for real, those dogs are often not suitable for average life with a family or person with a civilian job. They don’t need to be reliable off leash in a shopping mall, good with children, or be able to closely bond with certain people. Personal protection dogs do. Creating a personal protection dog is like combining two of the most significant jobs a dog can have: a service dog and a military dog, and then putting those dogs in the hands of regular (or not so regular, see Protection Dogs Wordwide’s clients) people who need them. To me, that is the ultimate dog, which is why my favorite breed is the Dobermann. When Louis created the Dobermann, he also created the personal protection dog.

                I think that protection is one of if not the most important thing a dog can offer to a human, next to companionship. That peace of mind and safety that you feel when you know you have a dog like that is priceless. But unfortunately, I don’t have $50k lying around, so I’m planning on learning how to train them myself.
